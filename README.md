### Introduction

The inspiration for us to build this game was because as a child we used to play a pong game and always wonder what really makes the ball move back and forth and how the paddle moves with just a key press. Game development is highly creative process, we feel creating a new game needs a lots of basic understanding, so we want to be strong enough to build a game on our own. So we took this game as a basic challenge for moving forward for the real one.

In the game we introduced music behind the scene so that it helps players to enjoy and play with calmness with soothing music.The reason behind this stucture is we want the game to be classy and simple.
