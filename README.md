### Introduction
Pong's design requires only basic graphics and sound, which can make it a fun and challenging project to tackle. It is relatively simple compared to modern video games, and it serves as a great starting point to craete a game from scratch.


### Reasoning behind the structure
The design choices for a Pong game are typically driven by a desire to create a fun and engaging experience that is easy to learn but challenging to master. The game's simple mechanics and basic physics engine make it accessible to players of all skill levels, while the fast-paced gameplay and competitive elements keep players engaged.


### Future Works,
1.You can optimize the game engine by profiling the code, identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks, and using efficient algorithms and data structures.
2.Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly important in games, and improving the game engine's AI capabilities can greatly enhance the player experience. 

### Generalization
While Pong is a two-player game, you could create a version of the game that allows for more players. For example, you could create a four-player game where each player has their own paddle and they have to work together to keep the ball in play.
